`dawg, reincarnation?_____________________________
i just woke up and i had the wild thought________
           
what if there’s an animal________________________
that remembers its past life?____________________
like every mouse knows how they were as humans___
and that’s their identity and then they become___
mouse and all the mice know “o yeah Deborah she__
was from South Africa and she died in a car______
accident she’s moved into my neighborhood________
recently!”_______________________________________
but the only humans that became mice were the____
ones who hated mice, so now they’re like “o well_
i guess it’s nice to officially meet you lil_____
homie”___________________________________________
gaahhhahaha idz dtoo much humans wouldn’t be able
to handle knowing that happens___________________
         
becoming that exact thing you hate?______________
             
oooosh how to handle that__________😵‍💫____________
_____________________________________If they knew
                       
_I think some people wouldn’t know how to take it
________and maybe their life purpose would change
                   
____since they knew what would happened when they
______________________________________________die
                 
__________________Society would be very different
       
that thing that they know would happen when they_
die wouldn’t happen anymore if they didn’t hate__
mice👀lol that would be so fried u become what u_
hate and the only way to escape reincarnation is_
to not hate anyone or anything or to hate very___
temporary things like vape cravings and twitches_
_________________________________________________
            
_____________That would make people think in some
sort of god though_______________________________
                
_____Because your purpose is to not “hate” and to
_____embrace and I feel like people would want to
_______know who came up with that concept and who
_________________________determines that_________
        
i mean people think in a god already with the____
way the universe currently works as we___________
understand it, like why does the sun orbit the___
moon?_________________ god. _____________________
why is the earth perfect distance from the sun___
for life?_____________ god ______________________
          
_________Right but the fact that reincarnation is
____determined by who hates and who doesn’t would
_______maybe make atheists believe in someone who
__________determines the hate____________________
                
the hatred is determined by the person hating____
id think________or adjacent to that idea_________
_______________________________So they would know
                   
and i guess the idea kinda implies it’s really___
really really hard not to hate anyone or_________
anything or, more lightly put, find no___________
frustration or nuisance or negative pull or______
whatever from anything___________________________
______________________That would be hard for many
_______________________Especially people in power
_______________________________But sucks for them 
                           
LMAO that would piss off Putin and all them big__
gunned folks ohohoooo i think idzaa good ideaaa__
_________________________________________________
Putin’s scientists go up to him and are like_____
“dawg we found out that you actually become______
everything you hate most when you die” and Putin_
just scoffs and terminates him and says “mmm not_
what i want to hear who is next”_________________
