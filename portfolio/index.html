										<h3>album</h3>
										<div>
											<p class="indent">
												I produced, mixed and mastered an album with 8 songs for singer-songwriter Ella Faye in 48 hours.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												The overarching sentiment of the album is nostalgia, using lo-fi elements creatively with some editing, additional layered recordings and other minimal effects to give the listener the feeling Ella Faye has towards the songs in the album she recorded as a child. Ella recorded the songs 5-10 years ago during her tween/teenage years, and she dug up bounces of the songs (i.e. vocal with instrumental recording mixed together) for me to produce, mix and master.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												After discussing the nature of the project and how she relates to the songs now, I made some recommendations for the mix and she decidedly agreed and wanted to try it out. She wanted the songs to sound more coherent and blended as one unit playing continuously. I recommended we have the whole album played through a cassette along with a poem at the beginning and end meant as a synopsis of her relationship to the songs now.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												The songs weren't well mixed to begin with, but I worked with what I had. Using Ableton stock plugins, iZotope, Ozone 9 and Insight 2, I made the songs sound coherent, providing a narrative for the listener. Ella continuously gave her input as I kept making tweaks and changes. She sent me some recordings of her reciting the poem she wrote used as the intro to the album, and I edited & processed the recordings to sound eloquent and mystical. The rest of the album sounds like it's played on a dusty cassette, everything from the "play" click, to the little lo-fi elements throughout (i.e. hiss & clicks, startup pitch bend, compression, etc.), to the final "stop" click. The final commentary on the last track is meant to sound like both the current Ella and the younger Ella coming to the same realization.

										<h1>generative microcomputer synths</h1>
										<h2>Aug - Dec '24</h2>
										<h3>audio programming</h3>
										<div>
											<p class="indent">
												I made a set of generative microcomputer digital synthesizers using RNBO (from Max/MSP) for software, and Raspberry Pis for hardware. The synths can be controlled by a MIDI controller or OSC messages over the network, and the stereo audio can be outputted via analog or bluetooth connection.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												I created different programs that can be installed on the Raspberry Pis to generate different sounds, most of which are generative. This means that the user sets parameters to control the synth's use of randomness to generate notes over time on its own. The user also has manual control over the timbre of the sound being generated.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												I created one program which is meant to synchronize looped playbacks of audio files over multiple Raspberry Pis at once. This was mostly designed for multichannel sound work (i.e. work with more than two speakers) or installations where the multichannelsound needs to be played back in sync.

												I was the mastering engineer for Ella Faye's single <i>Aurora</i>. The song is an intimate soulful performance of a piano and vocals. Using my own mastering setup with Logic Pro X, iZotope Ozone 9 and spectral scopes, I mastered the stereo bounce provided by the producer. I did some light EQing, compression and stereo widening of different frequency bands for a more balanced mix of a dynamic sound. I reduced the scratchiness of the mix and brought out the vocals in the most powerful moments without diminishing the intensity of the piano. I used Joni Mitchell's and Aretha Franklin's music as reference.

												Csound is a sound synthesis and signal processing language. The GUI was created with Cabbage, a code editor specifically designed for creating GUIs for Csound. I was introduced to Csound in my Csound class with Dr. Richard Boulanger at Berklee College of Music, and I developed my skills in audio programming and signal processing through this project. Using documentation and the Cabbage forum, I learned how to make audio-plugins that can be used on any DAW.

												This video is an audio visualization of an ambient song I created using a MaxMSP patch I made and some syncrhonized changes made on Ableton Live. I edited the video on iMovie.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												The MaxMSP patch I made is called cRaYoN SyNTH. It is a generative additive synthesizer that I use to create music and soundscapes. "Generative" means the notes are generated by the synthesizer based on the parameters I set. The logic behind the note generation is complex: chance and probability algorithms prioritize some notes over others, and the rhythm of the harmony's note generation slowly shifting rhythmic divisions over time while the bass generates a new note every 1.5 measures. The timbre of the harmony also subtly shifts over time to seamlessly modulate up a perfect 5th in key every 2.5 minutes, at which point the bass's note generation boundaries also shift up a perfect 5th.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												A basic reverb and delay were added in Ableton Live to the mix to create a more immersive experience. At certain points synchronized with the video, little clicks and pings are added for shock and intended as an unexpected unease to quickly cruise back into calmness from, having parallels with my own life. The video is a slow motion recording I took alongside the Charles River in Boston where I found a cool wooden platform and placed a flower on it. I synchronized the movement of the camera with my breath. Afterwards, I decided to make each motion into the flower a different memory to revisit.

We mixed what we already had in the project across the 8 channels and added more elements as we saw fit. We took turns as the producer; while one was listening in the space and shooting out ideas, the other would implement them. After two sessions, we were both satisfied with the result and decided the piece was finished. I then made an audio-reactive Jitter (MaxMSP) patch to control the visuals of the piece, incorporating eerie found footage with TV static and grainy videos. Then I showed Alice how to control the patch, and she performed the visual aspect of the piece in a live setting.

										<h1>Modular Ensemble</h1>
										<h2>Aug - Dec '23</h2>
										<h3>performance (EDI)</h3>
										<div>
											<p class="indent">
												I was one of six sound design musicians in a performing ensemble called <i>Modular Ensemble</i>. We rehearsed and performed with Eurorack modules in a 4-channel surround sound space. We each create our own patches on the Eurorack modules and route the stereo signal to our own DAWs, on which we apply our own light processing/effects and mix the signal to the 4-channel surround sound space after queueing it on our headphones. We improvise off of each other's ideas in the surround sound space for the most part, listening intently to each other's sounds and responding to them with our own.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												Every week for 14 weeks we performed in a 4-act show, each act lasting about 15 minutes, each with prediscussed themes. Improving our skills in sound design, improvisation, intent listening, and performance every week, we were able to create the most unique and engaging experience for the audience on the last week.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												As artists, we created a strong bond with each other in ways words fail to describe; it was impossible to distinguish who was who in the mix considering everyone is designing sound and developing their roles in the space at different points in time. It was a true experience of unity and collaboration.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												This project was developed through a modular ensemble course at Berklee College of Music under the guidance of professor Matthew Davidson.

										<h2>Nov '23</h2>
										<h3>8-ch composition</h3>
										<div>
											<p class="indent">
												This 8-channel surround sound composition titled <i>LoSS HYPNoSIS</i> is a piece I created that gives the sense of being hypnotized to experience a state of loss. Although loss is quite the profound experience and may have a bad connotation, loss can also be beautiful; the loss of a bitter grudge, a painful memory or a weakening prejudice is a liberating experience. Although loss——whether good or bad——can be quite painful, this piece is meant to ease and hypnotize the listener into accepting loss, if the listener so chooses to listen.
											</p><br><p class="indent">
												I developed most of the soundscape with Eurorack modules recorded and mixed across the 8 channels (7 speakers and 1 subwoofer) in Ableton Live. I layered one part over the next to create a sense of depth while preserving the simplicity of the emerging idea. I mix some parts in the surround sound space to lightly whirl around the listener, while other parts are panned in the center or in specific channels. At the peak point of the piece, there is one part designated for the subwoofer, vibrating the room and the listener's body to create a sense of weight. Although a stereo mixdown of the piece is available, the piece is best experienced in a surround sound space.

											The purpose of Ambient Night is to let the mind calm listening to soundscapes while sitting or lying down. Eliott's part in the night was as a performer and mixer in a collaborative ambient performance, with Eliott on EDI and Eurorack modules while processing other performers (Tan Monsoreenusorn on EWI, Nick Smucker on guitar) on Ableton Live. Eliott's act was the first in a 5-act show. The recording you are currently listening to is of the act  split into 3 sections, each with their own theme:

										<h3>audio programming</h3>
										<div>
											<p class="indent">
												I developed a program called <i>relax.ing.c</i> written in C (a general-purpose programming language) that allows a user to generate a random playlist of sounds from a database of audio files, each meant to be relaxing and soothing. When the user selects a playlist in the program, the sounds are played in a random order, with fade-ins and fade-outs to create a smooth transition between each sound. The playlists include: birds, rivers, thunderstorms, jazz, ambient and more.
